JustGiving API Demo

    Make a donation with reference code
    Retrieve donations for given reference code
    Retrieve donation for given ID

Those three calls are complete flow to make a donation and then get aggregated donations for specific reference, and then get details for specific donation. Additionally when you succeed make a donation you will get in response donationId as a URL parameter.

Check out our chat at JabbR, where you can ask question and discuss about API.

At our Github repository you can find complete collection for Postman. Feel free to import and play with it.
