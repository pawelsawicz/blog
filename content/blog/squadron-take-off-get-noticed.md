Get Noticed

This is the time!

Unfortunately last year I didn't take part in Get Noticed! If you don't know what it is, checks this website, translate to English should do work.
In short, "Get Noticed" is a contest where for three months you have to work on
your personal project, that you come up and you write about it on your blog, how amazing idea is that?

The reason for that is simple Get Noticed! by other people, go out from your comfort zone!
Squadron as a tool for distributed load testing

The project that I am going to build is a tool for load testing. The main reason for that is I couldn't find a tool or a product that would fit my needs. What I am looking for are those three main features: simple DSL that describe scenarios and endpoints under test, being distributed that works easily with major cloud providers, runnable in most of the OS and Linux distros

Technical goals are still in progress, mainly because I don't want to be very rigid, currently, my trello board is in a big mess. I will try to share with you a draft of some goals. You will see how do I manage tasks, and goals.

On the other hand, my personal goals from this contest and project, are very different than usual tech person. I would like to that my main takeaway would be an experience in creating a product from scratch. That I could potentially make a profit. There will be a lot of knowledge not very technical but around that, like marketing-ish, SEO, customer tracking, OKRs. In general getting a first customer is much harder than coding, at least for me!
What technology?

Well technology is not really that important in this project, but we have to distinct here two different projects:

    Core application that does load testing: it is going to be NET Core.
    Website that allows you to manage your scenarios and work with cloud providers: that is going to be ReactJs and some free web templates

I chose ".NET Core" because it's still my main platform that I work and it will be much simpler to create first iterations of that project. I strongly consider rewriting that into GoLang/C++ and some point.
Take off!

Good luck to everyone that take part in "Get Noticed!" you are amazing! I might show up at YouTube so stay tuned ;)
