Few hours ago my second application for Windows Phone just released, this time I made application for Build Stuff conference. Just check this out and please let me know about any issue or things to improve, via mail pawel@sawicz.eu or in comment below.

Of course it's first release, and application will be updated if any new speaker or session come out.
