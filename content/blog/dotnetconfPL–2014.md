Hey!

Hey all I would like to invite you to second edition of dotnetconfPL. If you hear about it first time then check out last edition. As you may guess this conference is in Polish, we were inspired by global edition, so we decided to do it in Polish.

At this year we have few more licences to raffle during our event, six resharper and three ncrunch. Thank for all sponsors!

This edition has seven technical oriented talks and one soft oriented talk, we tried, and we want to experiment this approach.
When?

18 October 2014, we are going to start at 3:00 PM GMT+2
Where?

Internet, so you can join to us whenever you can.
