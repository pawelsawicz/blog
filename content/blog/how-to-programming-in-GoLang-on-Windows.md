Recently I started programming in GoLang, for one project that I want to contribute to, terraform. For me, it was natural to get working GoLang on Windows.

So I downloaded GoLang, and terraform then I tried to compile and it happened...

Basically, my execution path got too, which is known issue on Windows.

That's why it's impossible to having working bigger projects in GoLang on Windows because you can't even compile it. GoLang requires directory structure so you can very easily reach max limit of chars in your execution path.
Conclusion, it is impossible to even to compile bigger project....go with Linux or OSX
