When I was surfing on the net I came across to this tool, named “Windows Live Writer” . You can link it with wordpress and just use this as a editor for your posts.
It seems to be quite good, tool also have large gallery of plug-ins .

Few test to shows what we can do by this.

You can easily copy & paste from Visual Studio to editor without worry about formatting because it keep it. :)

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq; 
using System.Text; 
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace migrationsTest { 

    class Program 
    {
        static void Main(string[] args) 
        { 

        } 
    }
}
```
