I give you more information about my plan for next few blog post. First of all I'm going to engage in most popular ORMs, and pull them to pieces. I will be checking their performance, then I take care of their pluses and minuses like missing features or having unique mechanism. I think I can devote 2-3 blog post about ORMs.

Secondly, I want to write something about, it is XNA and Windows Phone 7.5 ( I know that it's now unsupported technology but I had spent a lot of time on this and I would like to share my observations. Before new year I would like to achieve just few more goals like finish my project website, and send CV to companies therefore I'm looking for a job or just practise  (still under graduation).

Happy Christmas every one!
