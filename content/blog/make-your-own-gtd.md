GTD - Getting Things Done. Let me make mod for it ;). CGTD - (clear getting things done)
When I was starting with GTD, and managing my time methods. I have read full of articles about it.
After using these all principals, in a few weeks I came across a problem. Wasting too much time to planning everything, and small amount of tasks was done. (too massive applications, and too many options) - lot of doing, done nothing. Then I decided to simplify everything.

    Define you plan TODO list once a week, then just update your progress.
    Do it quick! dont use enormous application that just make trash from your plan
    USE monotasking! throw away multitasking!
    Finally, don't leave problems/ tasks at the last moment.

First of all, you have to plan your TODO list. You have to know where are you and what you have to do in the next order (it's very important because you don't forget about anything). Pick one day in week to create TODO list (for me its Sunday evening) When I am sure that I accomplish everything. (If not just move to next week with the most importance level, but try to don't have arrears).

Next, you have to use only one app if it's possible - it can't take too much time. I am using Microsoft One Note 2013.

It's very simple TODO list but I just know what I have to do, without description, if you need, make long title. Last but not least, focus on one thing, finish it properly. If your head is messed up by ten thing, you fail quickly.

How my TODO list works ? Simple!.Write and DO IT! Without sorting to a categories, marking and all of this s*it. If something goes wrong(it's understandable), cross it and write to next weekend and your work start over from doing this. I'm using it for three months and I can say that I feel my productivity has increased. It's mine mod for GTD - CGTD :)
